## Computer Architecture Seminar (Graduate Course) @ Hallym University
## 컴퓨터 구조 세미나: 한림대학교 컴퓨터공학과 대학원, Spring 2019

### 최신 인공지능 기술인 딥러닝의 가속기 구조(Accelerator Architecture)에 대한 수업 및 프로젝트를 진행합니다.

- Instructor : Prof. Jeong-Gun Lee
   - Email: Jeonggun.Lee@hallym.ac.kr
- Time : 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM, every Thuesday 
- Place : 1219

> This class is for learning recent advanced deep learning algorithm and computer system architecture for accelerating the deep learning algorithm. From the half point of the course, each student is expected to conduct an individual project on object detection. Particularly the topic of ``people counting`` or ``crowd counting`` is recommended.
